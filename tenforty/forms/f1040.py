"""Form 1040 compute.

v1: consumes raw engine output from the reference XLSX (computed by the
orchestrator) and re-keys it to PDF-ready field names. A later plan will
port the 1040 math to native Python and make the XLSX oracle-only.

This module has no filesystem dependencies; the orchestrator owns engine
invocation and hands `compute` the raw result dict.
